##Dataset description
The original [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/indian-medicinal-leaves-dataset) contains 80 plant species ,  it is so clumsy , so i done manuall data cleaning and picked 47 class and split them into [train dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OjDoF7BuDFnJNbX7WZB9jAdZ7ljfNupH?usp=drive_link) and [validation dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_W3QcWzqtUYmQ9uf4p7hd6dqiNxqAisg?usp=drive_link) .
